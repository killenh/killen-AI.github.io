### Technology Product Manager, Budding Software Engineer

Business nerd turned geek. While I don't have formal technical training, I am passionate about technology and teaching myself programming and computer science to deepen my technical chops in my role as a Product Manager.

I'm always looking for projects to work on to practice and expand skills, and always interested in learning tips and tricks.
